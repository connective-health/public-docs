## Basics

Seamless integration with your Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to push the Connective Health document(s) into your workflow.

## About

Our EHR API Integration allows us to securely deliver the Connective Health patient care summaries directly 
into your EHR system, streamlining workflows and giving maximum flexibility for labelling and tagging patient chart attachments. 
This integration is available for select EHR systems and provides a more efficient way to manage your clinical data. 
Please contact your account manager to confirm which EHRs this feature is available for.

## How it Works

Once we've processed your patient's information, we will securely transfer any created documents or updates
directly into your EHR. Depending on the EHR system you use, the setup process may involve filling out a form to grant us access to your system.

For example, the process for Athena's direct EHR integration is:

1. Filling out the [Athena Authorization & Consent Form](https://marketplace.athenahealth.com/authorization-consent?product=connective-health-inc) for your organization
2. Provide Connective Health your Athena Practice ID value (generally a 5-digit number)

If you're interested in this option, please reach out to your account manager to confirm EHR compatibility and discuss the necessary setup steps.
