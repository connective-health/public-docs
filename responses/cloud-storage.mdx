## Basics

Delivery to a cloud storage provider object storage can be configured as needed which will enabled documents (PDFs or FHIR bundles) to be pushed to a cloud storage location of your choosing.

Part of the configuration is a templated object name which is where the document will be written to.

### Available Dynamic Values

| Property           | Description                                                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `patientFirstName` | Patient first name                                             |
| `patientLastName`  | Patient last name                                              |
| `mrn`              | Patient MRN                                                    |
| `correlationId`    | Connective Health Correlation ID                               |
| `yyyy`             | Four-digit year                                                |
| `MM`               | Two-digit month                                                |
| `dd`               | Two-digit day                                                  |
| `documentType`     | Document type. Required to be part of the configured location  |
| `ext`              | File extension. Required to be part of the configured location |

A reasonable default would be `incoming_files/[yyyy]/[MM]/[dd]/[correlationId]_[mrn]_[patientLastName]_[documentType].[ext]`

## AWS S3 Setup

We connect to AWS S3 using a federated web identity authz model. This allows for security without the need to exchange static secrets.

1. Create (or identify) an S3 bucket which should be used for Connective Health to push documents to
    1. Our recommendation is to create a new bucket for this specific purpose to prevent accidental data leakage or other unexpected problems
2. Create a new Role under the IAM section of your AWS Console
    1. The name can be anything you want, for example ch-assume-role-policy
3. Under this Role, create a new custom trust policy by editing the JSON of the policy
    1. Set the policy to
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"Federated": "accounts.google.com"
			},
			"Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
			"Condition": {
				"StringEquals": {
					"accounts.google.com:sub": [
						"value depends on environment"
					]
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```
We will provide you with the appropriate Google Account `sub` value based on the environment (staging or production).

1. Under the role add new permissions
    1. The permissions should provide these permissions (at least):
        * s3:PutObject
        * s3:GetObject
        * s3:ListBucket
        * s3:GetBucketLocation
2. Make sure to populate the resources array with the S3 bucket and objects
3. Here is a complete example


```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ch-test-protected-storage",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ch-test-protected-storage/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
On the Role page, under the Summary section there is an ARN value. Copy this value and provide it to Connective Health
