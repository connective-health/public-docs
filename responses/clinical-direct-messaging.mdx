## About

Clinical direct messaging (CDM) or simply [Direct](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fact-sheets/the-direct-project.pdf) is a mechanism for sending protected health information to another provider or entity securely and in a standards compliant manner.

There are several different standards which allow for utilizing direct messaging within an EHR. Your EHR likely already has support for one of these built in.

## How it Works

Once we are done processing the patient's information, we will deliver any documents created back to you via CDM. The address we use can be either preconfigured by us or can be sent with your API request.
