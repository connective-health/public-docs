        # Data Requirements

        **Populate all known data**. It is required for processing that as much information as possible is supplied.

        All active clinical information for a patient should be supplied in every API request.
        That information is used to satisfy reciprocity requirements of the various health information exchanges
        that Connective Health participates in. Failure to populate known clinical information for a patient is
        a violation of health information exchange reciprocity rules, and may result in the termination of information exchange.

        ## Overview
        Clinical patient record to share with other providers on the network. This record will ONLY be shared if the patient has ALREADY been the subject of a patient search due to either a scheduled appointment or an incoming ADT event.
