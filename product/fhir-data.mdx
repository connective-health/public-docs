# Basics

For customers interested in the structured dataset underpinning our product suite (Care Summary, Risk Adjustment, and Quality Gap Closure), Connective Health offers a FHIR data product. The dataset is deduplicated, normalized, and curated using best-in-class data cleansing, with a longer lookback period. In some cases, the dataset can stretch back more than twenty years.

The structure of Connective Healthâ€™s FHIR interactions and resources are all based on the [FHIR R4](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/) specification. Whenever possible, the resources will also implement the corresponding [US Core 6.1.0 profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) and will pass validations.

In the event that the source data does not satisfy FHIR or US Core profile validations, we will still send it, allowing the customer final control over whether to ingest, correct, or disregard the data.


# Interaction Patterns

## Push

* Customer is able to have a FHIR bundle pushed to them
  * Via an S3 bucket (currently available)
  * Azure (soon to be available)
  * Google Cloud Storage (soon to be available)

## Pull

* Customer is able to request a FHIR bundle on demand (soon to be available)

# Bundles

## Patient Summary Bundle

Base element is a [Bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) resource, individual FHIR resources will eventually also be available. All information has been deduplicated, normalized, augmented, and curated prior to inserting into FHIR format.
