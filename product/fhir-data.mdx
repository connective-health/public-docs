# Basics

For customers interested in the structured dataset underpinning our product suite (Care Summary, Risk Adjustment, and Quality Gap Closure), Connective Health offers a FHIR data product. The dataset is deduplicated, normalized, and curated using best-in-class data cleansing.

The structure of Connective Health’s FHIR interactions and resources are all based on the [FHIR R4](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/) specification. Whenever possible, the resources will also implement the corresponding [US Core 6.1.0 profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) and will pass validations.

The curation approach is not one-size-fits-all -- instead, it is targeted and configurable. In cases where recency matters (e.g. encounters), there are time-based limits. In other cases (e.g. chronic diseases, medications), there are clinical rules to filter by relevance. In some cases, the dataset can stretch back more than twenty years -- but only if clinically relevant and "clean".

In the event that the source data does not satisfy FHIR or US Core profile validations, we will generally still send it, allowing the customer final control over whether to ingest, correct, or disregard the data.


# Interaction Patterns

## Push

Customer is able to have a FHIR bundle pushed to them:
* Via an S3 bucket (currently available)
* Azure (soon to be available)
* Google Cloud Storage (soon to be available)

## Pull

Customer is able to request a FHIR bundle on demand (soon to be available).

# Bundles

## Patient Summary Bundle

Base element is a [Bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html) resource, individual FHIR resources will eventually also be available. All information has been deduplicated, normalized, augmented, and curated prior to inserting into FHIR format.
