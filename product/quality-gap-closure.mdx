Connective Health provides an optional product to close more quality gaps. This product identifies clinical activity from outside providers that is relevant for HEDIS quality measures or star ratings and is missing from the receiving providerâ€™s EHR, e.g. recent A1c results, historical colorectal screenings, etc.

Quality Gap Closure is available for virtually all HEDIS quality measures.
