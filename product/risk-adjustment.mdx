Connective Health provides an optional product to improve risk adjustment accuracy. This product identifies diagnoses from outside providers that are missing from the receiving providerâ€™s EHR, then pulls supporting information, such as lab results or imaging reports, and flags them for the receiving provider.

Risk Adjustment Suspecting is available for Medicare Advantage, ACA, and Medicaid risk models.
