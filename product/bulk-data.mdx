# Formats

Whenever possible, Connective Health will support your bulk data needs. While [FHIR](/product/fhir-data) is preferred
we will support a variety of other export formats as needed.

## CSV

CSV files are a good choice when loading into a relational database or processing with a custom application.

## Excel

Excel is a good optional when being reviewed by a human. Note, Excel has several limitations for
column lengths which cannot be worked around and will likely truncate certain next from a note.

## Other

Contact us if you have a more specialized need.
