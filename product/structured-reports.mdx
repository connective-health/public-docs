# Formats

While [FHIR](/product/fhir-data) is preferred, we will support a variety of other export formats as needed, particularly in early stages of implementation before a full FHIR implementation is completed.

For example, a provider may want to export all imaging reports for certain patients for clinical validation (often hundreds of pages). The FHIR data product will eventually deliver this information, however Excel exports can be delivered in the interim.

## CSV

CSV format is a good choice when loading into a relational database or processing with a custom application.

## Excel

Excel is a good choice when being reviewed by a human. Keep in mind that Excel has several limitations for
column lengths which cannot be worked around and will likely truncate certain next from a note.

## Other
