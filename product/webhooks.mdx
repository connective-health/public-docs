# Overview

Webhooks are a technique for informing a system or user of an event that has taken place.
This type of architecture is especially helpful for an asynchronous system like Connective Health's products.

Our implementation is very loosely based on the open source [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com)
specification that is in active development.

Each webhook is implemented as an `HTTP POST` to a URL (or URLs) specified by the customer. The basic content
of each POST will be this. The `type`, `correlationId`, and `timestamp` will always be included. The `data` section
is optional, but if specified will contain additional information specific to the webhook type.

```json Webhook Example
{
  "type": "patient.found",
  "correlationId": "4352bfba-506c-4ffc-b1ba-78e56d0d4ddc",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-25T19:44:46.516663854Z",
  "data": {
    "key": "value",
    "anotherKey": "value2"
  }
}
```

# Implementation

## Event Types

Please contact your account manager if there are other event types you would like to see supported.

| Event Type                  | Status      | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `patient.insufficientData`  | Available   | This event may be due to several issues including the patient not being found or there not being sufficient data for the patient for the data to be delivered |
| `patient.found`             | Coming soon | The patient was identified via one of our connected networks                                                                                                  |
| `document.deliveryComplete` | Coming soon | A document (either PDF or FHIR bundle) was successfully delivered                                                                                             |


## Security

Currently, no authentication is supported for the webhook content. The `correlationId` should be validated against
previously sent customer records if necessary.

Only `https` URLs are supported.

## Retries

Webhooks are processed on a best effort basis. If there is a communication error (anything other than an HTTP 2xx response)
then the message will be retried several times with [progressively longer time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) between retries.

## Special Considerations

### Missing Delivery

In certain error situations a webhook may not be delivered as expected. This should be rare, but it is possible.

### Multiple Deliveries

Webhooks are intended to be at least once semantics. While we strive to only deliver each webhook exactly once, for a
variety of reasons a single webhook may be sent multiple times. Care should be taken by the receiver to properly handle
this situation.

### Erroneous Delivery

In extremely rare circumstances a webhook may be sent and then later found to be incorrect. An example would be the
delivery of a `patient.insufficientData` webhook being delivered, but due to a system error it was found that the patient
was able to be found and processed successfully. In this rare case, the webhook may be sent but a PDF is later delivered.
