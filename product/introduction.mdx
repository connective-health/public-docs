The Connective Health product is designed to be highly configurable, seamlessly matching existing clinical workflows while requiring minimal technology integration.

## Content delivery timing

* In advance of scheduled patient visits
* Upon ADT notification
* After patient visits

For example, a customer may want a Care Summary delivered two weeks after each visit in order to confirm adherence to a treatment plan, e.g. referrals, medication compliance.

## Content delivery method

* Within the EHR as a chart attachment
* File directories, e.g. Amazon S3
* Secure fax

## Population vs. individual patient visits

* Real-time access for individual patients, typically timed to patient visits
* Bulk access for populations, typically at weekly or monthly intervals
