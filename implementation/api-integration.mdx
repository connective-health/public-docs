## Setup

To initiate a request for retrieval of outside medical records and generation of consolidated
patient care summaries, Connective Health allows customers to make API requests as needed for their patients.

When implementing this option, it is critical to populate the API with as much
clinical information about each patient as possible (ex: diagnoses, medications).
This information is shared back with the various health information exchange networks
as part of their reciprocity requirements.

More information on the Connective Health Clinical Data Processing API can be found [here](/scheduled-appointments/patient-data-processing).
