# Request

To initiate the care summary processing, multiple integration options
are available. The Connective Health Patient Processing API
allows the customer to initiate the processing upon request.
Alternatively, Connective Health supports EHR integrations with larger vendors.
For customers using an EHR integration, Connective Health will process and push
information to the customer according to agreed upon schedules and fact patterns.
The API gives the user more control over configurations, timing, and volumes. The
EHR integration is lower touch for the customer though might not support all features.

More information on the Connective Health Patient Processing API can be [found here](/scheduled-appointments/introduction).

For information on supported EHR integrations, please reach out to your account manager.
