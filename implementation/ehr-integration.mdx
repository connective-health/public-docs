## Setup

To initiate a request for retrieval of outside medical records and generation of consolidated patient care summaries,
Connective Health supports EHR calendar integrations. For customers using this option,
Connective Health will process and push information to the customer according to eligible patients on the EHR calendar.

For information on supported EHR integrations, please reach out to your account manager.
