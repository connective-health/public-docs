# Overview

For users of the [Scheduled Appointment API endpoint](/clinical-data/patient-data-processing-v1) there are a few breaking changes that need to be accounted
for when migrating to the new [Patient Data API](/clinical-data/patient-data-v2) endpoint.

## New Capabilities

* **PHARMACY DATA!** The new `patientPanelDirectives.requestMedicationHistory` field can be set to `true` to indicate that pharmacy medication
history data should be queried before processing the patient. Setting this to `true` will incur several hours delays
in receiving PDFs and should only be used after consultation with your customer success representative.
* Patients with multiple (e.g. previous) addresses are now fully supported
* Requests for processing can now be sent in a single batch. The top level object accepts an array of requests
* Active and inactive diagnoses are accepted
* Diagnoses from any code system are accepted
  * ICD-10 (`2.16.840.1.113883.6.90`) is preferred

## Upgrade Steps

1. A top level `patientProcessingRequests` array is now required and is where most request data is populated
2. `patient.address` is now an array `patient.addresses`
3. `medicalSummaryPeriod` is now a property of `directives`
4. `activeIcd10Diagnoses` should now be added to the more generic `diagnoses` array and populated with a `codeSystem` value of `2.16.840.1.113883.6.90`. The `active` indicator must also be set appropriately
5. `activeIcd9Diagnoses` should now be added to the more generic `diagnoses` array and populated with a `codeSystem` value of `2.16.840.1.113883.6.103`. The `active` indicator must also be set appropriately
6. `activeSnomedDiagnoses` should now be added to the more generic `diagnoses` array and populated with a `codeSystem` value of `2.16.840.1.113883.6.96`. The `active` indicator must also be set appropriately
7. `batchId` is now specified at the top level request outside of the request records, it is still optional
8. `upcomingAppointmentDate` is no longer required
9. All fields which support arrays are no longer allowed to contain null elements
